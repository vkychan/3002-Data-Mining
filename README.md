# 3002-Data-Mining Group Project README

This repository contains the code and datasets for our group project (SDSC 3002 Data Mining Group 2) focusing on frequent pattern mining (FPM) methods.

## Datasets
- `grocerises_dataset.csv`: This dataset is used for baseline assessment.
- `product.csv`: This dataset is used for testing and extending the dataset for different FPM methods.

The datasets are provided in the `dataset.zip` file.

## Code Files
- `project_code.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook includes the code for baseline assessment and various FPM methods using the `grocerises_dataset.csv`.
- `project_code_extended.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook extends the dataset for different FPM methods using the `product.csv`.

## Installation
To install the required libraries for running the code, use the provided `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary Python libraries for running the project code.

## Running the Code
To run the code directly, open the Jupyter Notebooks (project_code.ipynb and project_code_extended.ipynb) in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially.
